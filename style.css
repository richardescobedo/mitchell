This theme was developed using Twitter's Bootstrap, and therefore all styling information is contained in the pertinent LESS and compiled CSS files. 

A special thanks to Eddie Machado for his Bones WordPress framework, as well as 320Press for developing WordPress Bootstrap, the foundation for a good amount of this theme's functionality.
